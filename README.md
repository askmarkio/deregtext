# Deregtext
This is the first application from the DeregSoftware suite of apps.

Or, at least, that is what I would like to think. This is nothing more than coding practice
as I learn how to code and learn Python. Though, it is very tempting to use this app daily, 
so I will have to think about what features I actually use and want.

## Functionality

At present, this is as basic as it can get. But here is what it can do:
- Save, Copy, Paste text

Lol. Yep.

### Default
- File type: Default file extension is '.dgt'. Nothing special. Just keeping with the app name.
